I have created SLLNode class which represents the node of SList.
I have created a SList class that contains two member variables: reference to head node and size of the list.
It also contains a method iterator() that returns a SListIterator's object and a toString() method that returns the LinkedList.
SListIterator is class that contains insert(),remove(),hasNext(),next() methods and a member variable currentNode which represents current node while
iterating through the list.
The object returned by iterator() is used to insert,remove,display the elements in the Singly Linked List.
SListDriver class creates object for Slist and uses the object returned by iterator() method to perform operations on the singly linked list.
Options are displayed for different operations using printOptions() method and operations are performed.
