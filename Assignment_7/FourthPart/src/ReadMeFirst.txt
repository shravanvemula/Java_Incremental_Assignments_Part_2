 * Create a Cycle interface, with implementations Unicycle, Bicycle and Tricycle.
 * Create factories for each type of Cycle, and code that uses these factories.
 *
 * I have created a Cycle interface and three classes Unicycle,Bicycle,Tricycle by providing
 * implementations for the methods in Cycle interface in each of these classes.
 * I have created three other classes UnicycleFactory,BicycleFactory and TricycleFactory
 * These three classes represents the factories of three different cycles and the code
 * that uses these factories is written in Factory class.
 * Factory class is my Main class.
