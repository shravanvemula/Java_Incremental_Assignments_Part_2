/**
 * Create three interfaces, each with two methods. Inherit a new interface that combines the three, adding a new method.
 * Create a class by implementing the new interface and also inheriting from a concrete class.
 * Now write four methods, each of which takes one of the four interfaces as an argument.
 * In main( ), create an object of your class and pass it to each of the methods.
 *
 * My three interfaces are IBatsmen,IBowler,IFielder and the fourth interface that  combines the three interfaces is IAllrounder.
 * My Concrete class is Scorecard that provides implementations for all the methods in the four interfaces .
 * My class that implements the fourth interface(IAllrounder) and the concrete class (Scorecard) is Statistics.
 * This class has four methods,each of which takes one of the four interfaces as an argument.
 * In main(), I have created object for Scorecard class and passed it to each of the methods.
